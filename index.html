		ProteinX is a molecular viewer that specializes in protein <a class="test" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation">mutations</a> and <a class="test" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_modelling">energy minimization</a> of these mutations to find the lowest potential energy state to stabilize the protein's structure.  It is the first freely available tool that offers high resolution 3D images in real-time, and uses simulated annealing to perform energy minimization on amino acid residues within seconds, instead of minutes like with other tools.<br>
