ProteinX 0.91 zip file
------------------------------------------------------

ProteinX is a molecular viewer that specializes in protein mutations and energy minimization of these mutations to find the lowest potential energy state to stabilize the protein's structure. It was the first freely available tool (release in 2006) that offers high resolution 3D images in real-time, and uses simulated annealing to perform energy minimization on amino acid residues within seconds.

PDB
------------------------------------------------------

ProteinX reads in PDB files, which can be downloaded from the PDB website http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do  There are also some sample PDB files located in the "Protein Data Files" directory.

Functions
------------------------------------------------------

ProteinX lets you perform a mutation on a selected amino acid residue, followed by energy minimization to find the lowest energy position of the new amino acid.  

The screenshot button switches to high resolution models before saving a screenshot to the ProteinX directory, resulting in sharper pictures.

Controls
------------------------------------------------------

Holding the left mouse button down will move the protein around.
Holding the right mouse button down lets you rotate the protein.
The mouse scroll wheel will let you zoom in and out.
Holding the middle mouse button down lets you change the direction of the lighting.
Double clicking any atom with the left mouse button will select the residue the atom belongs to.

------------------------------------------------------
Known Issues
------------------------------------------------------
- The window can only be resized before a protein file is opened, and can't be maximized or resized when you have a protein molecule on the screen.
